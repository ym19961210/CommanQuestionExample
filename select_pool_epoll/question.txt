1. why select can only listen 1024 fd?
    According to the def of /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/select.h

    /* The fd_set member is required to be an array of longs.  */
    typedef long int __fd_mask;

    /* Some versions of <linux/posix_types.h> define this macros.  */
    #undef	__NFDBITS
    /* It's easier to assume 8-bit bytes than to get CHAR_BIT.  */
    #define __NFDBITS	(8 * (int) sizeof (__fd_mask))
    #define	__FD_ELT(d)	((d) / __NFDBITS)
    #define	__FD_MASK(d)	((__fd_mask) (1UL << ((d) % __NFDBITS)))

    /* fd_set for select and pselect.  */
    typedef struct
    {
        /* XPG4.2 requires this member name.  Otherwise avoid the name
        from the global namespace.  */
    #ifdef __USE_XOPEN
        __fd_mask fds_bits[__FD_SETSIZE / __NFDBITS];
    # define __FDS_BITS(set) ((set)->fds_bits)
    #else
        __fd_mask __fds_bits[__FD_SETSIZE / __NFDBITS];
    # define __FDS_BITS(set) ((set)->__fds_bits)
    #endif
    } fd_set;

    /* Maximum number of file descriptors in `fd_set'.  */
    #define	FD_SETSIZE		__FD_SETSIZE

    fd_set is passed into the select to set corresponding bit to reflect whether there is event happends.
    And fd_set is actually array, which type is unsigned long int(bytes 8, 64bits), and array size is 1024/64 = 16.
    So fd_set can only reflect 1024 fds' status.
    To revise this value, linux keneral should be recomplined.

    And poll and epoll are not restricted by this limit. Because they don't use bitmaps.
    Poll use a link-list to save the fd status in kernel. And epoll use red-black trees.


2. select poll epoll advantages and disadvantages.

    Compare select and poll:
        1. poll doesn't have limit of 1024.
        2. poll still needs to do loop-query for all listen fds.
        3. poll doesn't need to clear fdbits after dealing one event.
        4. poll still need to copy the status of fds from kernel to users' space.

    epoll have advantages of all.

    But when fds' number is less than 1024 and every fd is active for most time, select and poll are recommend than epoll.
